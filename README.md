# Password-Cracking-Project

> Idea: The idea is to show beginners and people with interest in learning about password cracking how it is really done with real tools like John The Ripper and its GUI, Johnny. I will show a demo on how to crack passwords of newly created users with both the command line tool and its GUI. I will also explain more about the password file, what and how data is stored there, and how the toolkit works. 
 
> Objectives: The main objective for this project is really to show that passwords in fact can be cracked using Kali Linux powerful tools and to raise awareness of using strong passwords instead of weak, easy ones. 
 
> Deliverables: I will deliver a live demo, a small paper that explains how it is done and the underlying concepts, and most likely also a visual aid (presentation) to go with it. 
 
> Resources: For this project, I will be using my MacBook Pro as my host machine and will have Kali Linux running on a VM (VirtualBox). Softwares used aside from VirtualBox will be John The Ripper and its GUI, Johnny.
 
> References: yet to come, but mainly what Prof. Lambert had said in the previous classes as of the latest progress of the project.
